# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

A simple **AI** program that can play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against humans and improve from its games using **Reinforcement Learning**, as well as by training through **self-play**. Used python along with a MySQL database to store and update the knowledge of the AI. Based on Donald Michie's idea of the matchbox machine named **MENACE**.
